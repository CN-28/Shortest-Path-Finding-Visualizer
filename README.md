# 📘 About The Project
The player sets the start and end of the path, moreover it can build walls to make the path to the goal more difficult and after selection of the algorithm the player wants to see, application starts to visualize finding the shortest path from the start to the end.

## Implemented algorithms:
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- Bellman-Ford
- A*

## Why did I build this project?
I did Shortest Path Finding Visualizer project to get to know better the most popular and probably the most useful algorithms of finding the shortest paths. 
# 📈 Visualization example
The following visalization shows A* algorithm during the proccess of finding the shortest path.
