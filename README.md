# 📘 About The Project <a name="#about-the-project"></a>
The player sets the start and end of the path, moreover it can build walls to make the path to the goal more difficult and after selection of the algorithm the player wants to see, application starts to visualize finding the shortest path from the start to the end.

## Implemented algorithms:
- <strong>BFS
- Dijkstra
- Bellman-Ford
- A*</strong>

## Why did I build this project?
I did Shortest Path Finding Visualizer project to get to know better the most popular and probably the most useful algorithms of finding the shortest paths.

# 📈 Visualization example <a name="#visualization-example"></a>
The following visalization shows <strong>A* algorithm</strong> during the proccess of finding the shortest path.

# 🔧 Installation <a name="#installation"></a>
To run visualization app, you need to have <strong>pygame</strong> and <strong>pygame_gui</strong> installed.

<p>If you don't have it installed, open command prompt and enter the following commands.</p>

```bash
pip install pygame
```

```bash
pip install pygame_gui
```

<p>Now, you have all required modules to run visualizer. Just download the repository, open your command prompt in the repository and <strong>run main.py</strong> by typing:</p>

```bash
python main.py
```
